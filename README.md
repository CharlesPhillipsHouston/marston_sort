A better TLE reader that sorts by various parameters in the application

The critical part, sorting, was written by Mike Marston - imports a file of TLEs and allows user to sort by various parameters. User has to edit the 
application to determine what parameter is sorted by. 

I added a crude "GUI" interface where, if you run the application in Terminal, it asks which parameter you want to sort by!
